# site-responsivo
 
I created a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and media queries. The site adjusts its layout and content based on the size of the screen, providing an optimal viewing experience for users on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. HTML provides the structure of the site, CSS is used for styling, and media queries allow the site to adapt to different screen sizes. This project demonstrates the importance of responsive design in creating user-friendly websites that are accessible to a wide range of devices.
